Blocklist for (Mass) Media - No News? No Problem!

This is originally just for myself. A blocklist (e.g. for Adguard) that blocks any (mass) media and news sites. I could not find anything like this on the internet. No matter if conspiracy theories or mainstream headlines. Since I live in Germany, only German sites are represented here (so far).

I would be happy if you would add more sites. Who knows, maybe one day we will have a worldwide media blocklist here.
